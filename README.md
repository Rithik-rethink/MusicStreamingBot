# MusicStreamingBot

A python script which helps in streaming music using the youtube-dl and youtube-python-search modules , served by the urllib under the hood. The link of the song is first fetched and using the link the video is converted to mp3 and downloaded to play . The downloaded file is later deleted to not take up user file space. 
The script must be executed using "python3 Bot.py" in the command line.
